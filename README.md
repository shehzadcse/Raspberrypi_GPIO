Raspberrypi GPIO Remote Control
------------------

Remote control appliances via WebInterface by using a RaspberryPi + Node.js + GPIO Relay control board (turning On/Off a coffee machine, toaster, heater, etc from a webpage in your mobile phone, tablet or laptop)

NPM dependencies
------------------
Raspberry Pi GPIO Remote control dependes on the following node.js packages:

* rpi-gpio
https://github.com/JamesBarwell/rpi-gpio.js

* Flatiron

* Socket.io

* others - please check package.json

How to compile node.js on a RaspberryPi
------------------
https://github.com/nneves/Raspberrypi_NodeJS

How to get things running
------------------
Clone project and install Node.js necessary packages
```bash
git clone git://github.com/nneves/Raspberrypi_GPIO.git

cd Raspberrypi_GPIO

npm install
```

Raspberry Pi GPIO access requires sudo (for gpio access - still working on a safer solution)
```bash
sudo node app.js 8080

or (for quick testing)

npm start
```

Experimental testing with WebSockets protocol
------------------
```bash
sudo node app.js 8080 websockets
```
